# Message 1: Project Completion Update

As part of the Mycroft project, I have completed the task of building an Intelligence Agent workflow in N8N to perform sentiment analysis on Reddit posts. The objective was to extract posts from Reddit, analyze their sentiment, and store the results for further insights.

The workflow begins with a manual trigger to execute the process, followed by a Reddit node that fetches posts related to a chosen topic. The data is then cleaned and formatted using an Edit Fields node before being passed to the Sentiment Analysis model, which classifies each post as positive, neutral, or negative. I also integrated the Groq Chat Model for more advanced interpretation or quick summaries. Finally, the results are saved into a Google Sheet, allowing for easy tracking and analysis of sentiment trends over time.

This workflow demonstrates how Intelligence Agents can capture market awareness by monitoring community discussions. Future enhancements may include scheduling automated runs, connecting to visualization tools such as Power BI or Tableau, incorporating additional data sources like Twitter or financial news, and refining sentiment scoring for deeper insights.

For reference, I have attached a short video walkthrough that explains the workflow and its components, along with a screenshot of the workflow for quick visualization.

# Message 2: YouTube Content Proposal

Dear Media Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I've created an educational video tutorial demonstrating the Mycroft Social Sentiment Agent that I built using n8n workflow automation. This video showcases the complete implementation of our AI-powered investment intelligence system and would be valuable content for our YouTube channel.

**Video Details:**
* **Title:** Mycroft Social Sentiment Agent - Building AI-Powered Investment Intelligence with n8n
* **Duration:** Approximately 11 minutes
* **Content:** Complete walkthrough of the n8n workflow that collects data from multiple platforms (StackOverflow, GitHub, Reddit), processes it through AI sentiment analysis using Groq/Llama 3.1, and generates investment intelligence signals

**Video Link:** [LINK REMOVED]

**Suggested YouTube Description:**
"Learn how to build an AI-powered Social Sentiment Agent using n8n workflow automation. This tutorial demonstrates the complete implementation of the Mycroft Framework's Social Sentiment Agent, which analyzes social media discussions to generate investment intelligence.

What You'll Learn:
- Multi-platform data collection from StackOverflow, GitHub, and Reddit
- AI sentiment analysis using Groq API and Llama 3.1
- Topic classification and signal quality filtering
- Automated data storage with Google Sheets integration

# Message 3: Project Demo Completion

I've completed the recordings for the Mycroft project demo, showcasing the Financial Intelligence Agent I've built. The videos walk through the full n8n workflow starting from multi-source news collection, applying FinBERT-based sentiment and risk scoring, writing results to PostgreSQL, and generating daily intelligence reports and alerts.
