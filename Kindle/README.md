# Recommended Workflow for Illustrated Kindle Editions

### 1. Source and Clean the Text

* Start with a public domain text (Project Gutenberg or other).
* Open it in Sigil.
* Remove the Gutenberg boilerplate at the beginning and end.
* Retain only the story content and structure it with clean HTML tags (`<h1>/<h2>` for chapters, `<p>` for body text).

---

### 2. Establish Book Structure

For a professional Kindle-ready EPUB, include:

* **Title Page** – Book title, your name, and imprint (e.g., “Bear Brown LLC”).
* **Preface / Introduction** – Short explanation of why you illustrated this edition.
* **Illustrator’s Note** (optional) – Describe your approach, sketches, and artistic vision.
* **Table of Contents** – Generated by Sigil, but confirm headings are consistent.
* **Main Text** – The story itself.
* **About the Publisher** – A page at the end with “This edition © 2025 Bear Brown LLC,” plus optional website or contact.

---

### 3. Illustration Workflow

* Create and upscale your sketches in your preferred art tool.
* Before embedding, optimize images:

  * **Format**: JPEG for most; PNG only for line art or transparency.
  * **Dimensions**: about 1600 pixels on the long edge is sufficient for Kindle devices.
  * **File Size**: under 500 KB each, ideally below 1 MB.
* Place illustrations thoughtfully: major chapter openings and significant scenes. Illustrating every paragraph is not practical—files become too large, Amazon delivery costs rise, and readers may experience lag on e-ink devices.

### 4. CSS and Layout

Create a single clean stylesheet (e.g., `style.css`). Example:

```css
body {
  font-family: serif;
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0 5%;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.4em;
  text-align: center;
  margin: 2em 0 1em 0;
}

img {
  display: block;
  margin: 1em auto;
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

Keep CSS simple. Kindle devices strip out advanced styling. Focus on margins, spacing, headings, and making sure images scale cleanly.

### 5. EPUB to Kindle Conversion

* Export your edited EPUB from Sigil.
* Open it in **Kindle Previewer**. This will automatically convert the EPUB into Amazon’s **KPF** format.
* Check how it looks on multiple device previews (Kindle Paperwhite, Fire Tablet, phone).

---

### 6. Final Checks

* Confirm the TOC works correctly.
* Check images are scaled and centered.
* Verify metadata: title, author, and publisher set to “Bear Brown LLC.”
* Run Sigil’s EPUB validation or use epubcheck to ensure compliance.

---

### 7. Publishing

* Upload the EPUB or KPF to Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP).
* Set publisher/imprint name as Bear Brown LLC.
* Write a description that highlights your illustrated edition and preface.
* Choose appropriate categories (e.g., “Classics – Illustrated Editions”).

---

### Balance of Images and Text

* Recommended: one to three illustrations per chapter or major scene.
* Too many images will increase file size, slow rendering, and add to Amazon’s delivery fee (for books sold on 70% royalty).
* Upscale your sketches for clarity, but always compress for distribution.

### Summary Workflow

1. Acquire text → Clean in Sigil.
2. Build structure → Title, Preface, TOC, Main text, Publisher note.
3. Add illustrations → Optimized and embedded.
4. Apply simple, consistent CSS.
5. Export EPUB → Convert with Kindle Previewer.
6. Validate and test.
7. Publish on KDP under Bear Brown LLC.

Do you want me to prepare a **ready-to-use EPUB template** with placeholders for Title Page, Preface, one Chapter, an illustration, and clean CSS that you can reuse for each book project?
